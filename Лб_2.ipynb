For Line and Bar charts, this is an array of Numbers. These two charts are set to autoScale = true by default. But you can set that to false and provide minimum and maximum values. Set showScaleLabels to true to show the max and min values in labels off to the left as in the examples. The labelPrecision property can be used to determine how these are rounded off if necessary. The Bar Chart\\u2019s bar colors can be specified with barColor, and the Line Chart\\u2019s lines can be customized with lineColor and lineWidth.\\n\\nIn the Pie Chart, you can also pass an array Numbers to data, or you can pass an array of Objects, where each object has a value property, and optionally a label and color property. If no label is provided, the value is used as a label, rounded off again using labelPrecision. If you don\\u2019t want any label, pass in an empty string. If no color is provided, each pie slice will use predetermined color values. You can also pass in an array of color values to the colors property to use those instead. If you run out of color values, random colors will be assigned. Sorting of your data needs to be done manually, if you want the slices to appear in order of size. By default, the first slice starts at an angle of zero degrees. You can change this with beginningAngle, which is in degrees. There is no limit to the number of slices you can have, but too many will make the labels overlap. And more than that, you won\\u2019t even be able to see the smaller slices. There is no consolidation or hiding of tiny slices. That\\u2019s up to you to handle by tweaking your data first.\",\n          \"But by last week everything had changed.

I backed up my computer to protect all my data before opening the email (not really) and there it was - a reference to my knife. Sharon had given my knife to one of her guests, this woman Corie from New York City, to mail to me upon her arrival back to the US.

Carriers will have a chance to tap into that market if they can effectively evolve beyond their traditional role as network operators.\\n\\nAs loosely defined by Juniper, mobile Web 2.0 features the web as a platform for applications and the user as both creator and consumer of content. That broad definition includes offerings such as mobile Skype as well as basic chat services, social networks and location-aware services such as Foursquare and Gowalla that feature community. A combination of ads, data charges and premium services will be among the key revenue streams, Juniper said.\\n\\nThe market for mobile Web 2.0 is one that AT&T is trying to tap with Buzz.com, a new, Yelp-like social recommendations site that will likely embrace presence management as it matures. (The offering, which is aimed at helping users find the right local business based on reviews from friends and family, launched in January and is in closed alpha.) The problem for operators, though, will be in getting their apps in the hands of users on other networks. That\\u2019s an entirely new strategy for carriers, which have long deployed products and services solely to attract new subscribers and hold on to the customers they already have. If AT&T or any of its competitors can make a go of it, they could tap an entirely new business model beyond merely being mobile network operators.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \" M \",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The world has been developing in and out in all the areas and to create a difference in this competitive world... we need to change...\\nchange the way we take our things...\\nbut we rather change or atleast try to change..... we try the same routine work evryday and expect to get more\\nand when things fail such as losing a job, loss in business we would upset, discouraged, frustrated and keep on hanging to the same thing again and start complaining.\\nCHANGE IS GOOD.... LETS WELCOME IT..!!!\\nwondering wat is all about Cheese?? and what actually is all about \\\" Who Moved My Cheese??? \\\"\\n\\n\\nWell...!!!! Who moved my cheese?? is a simple parable that reveals profound thoughts. It is an enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. The story is about two mice called \\\"SNIFF\\\" and \\\"SCURRY\\\" and two little men ... smaller in size and who were similar to us people. Their names were \\\"HEM\\\" and \\\"HAW\\\"\\n\\nCheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job, loving relationship, money or a possession, health or spiritual peace of mind.\\n\\nAnd the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in.\\n\\nEveryday both the mice and men spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese. The mice had only Rodent brains while the men used their brains, filled with many beliefs. The common thing between the rodents and these men is tat every morning they went in search for the cheese.\\n\\nThe maze had confusing network of paths corridors and some of the chambers had delicious cheese. But there were also dark corners and blind alleys leading nowhere. It was an easy place to get lost. Those who found the way to secret chambers had to enjoy a better life.\\n\\nAfter much of searching they found a chamber C which had an enormous amount of richest quality of Cheese.Rodents used the trial and error method by racing through the corridors. While the men used their brains and beliefs and experience.\\n\\nHAVING CHEESE MADE THEM HAPPY.\\nBoth these men and rodents enjoyed the cheese everyday almost many many days and finally one day was such tat the cheese had to run out and there isnt left anymore.\\nRodents observed the minute details of cheese getting decreased day by day and they were ready for the situation and were ready for the hunt of new Cheese.\\nOn the otherhand these men based on their beliefs wondered \\\"Who moved their Cheese?\\\". Both HEM and HAW kept waiting for the cheese at the old place. Fearing that they might get lost in the maze they didnt start to find their way to new cheese and started starving and waiting in the old place. Both of them kept Hemming and Hawing for their old Cheese. But couldnt find any and increased frustration in them. It also created FEAR in them about what might happend if they get lost in finding new cheese..!!!\\nThey started evaluating the situation at Chamber C and waited there everyday and returned homes hungry.\\nTHEY WERE AFRAID OF CHANGE.\\n\\nMeanwhile,Rodents found out their new way and found a chamber N having more cheese than the older one.\\n\\nEverytime HAW wanted to go in search for the new Cheese. HEM would stop him. But one day in utter despair to find the new Cheese HAW started for his search leaving behind his friend HEM in the old chamber. He wrote on a wall so tat his friend had something to think about...\\nIF YOU DONOT CHANGE, YOU CAN BECOME EXTINCT.\\nand HAW in order to overcome his fear of getting lost in the maze ... he reminded himself as..\\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WEREN'T AFRAID?\\nhe continued his search and found a dark alley where he could smell some nice cheese\\nhe was afraid of what might be on the other end... and started walking towards it.\\nAND when he moved he felt free and rather more young than he is.\\n\\nWHEN YOU MOVE BEYOND YOUR FEAR, YOU FEEL FREE.!!!\\nbut he didnt find any cheese it had some little pieces left over near the chamber, someone had already visited the chamber and completed it. He gulped some cheese leftover and kept some for his friend in his pocket and wondered if HEM was still in chamber C\\n\\nAll the while throughtout his search he kept on noticing the changes in him.. and everytime he is feeling happy and on the way back to his friend HEM , HAW had been thinking of himself as..\\nwhy he hadnt moved out before to find the new cheese...??\\nTHE QUICKER YOU LET GO , OF OLD CHEESE THE SOONER YOU FIND NEW CHEESE.\\nIT IS SAFER TO SEARCH IN THE MAZE THAN REMAIN IN A CHEESELESS SITUATION.\\nOLD BELIEFS DONOT LEAD YOU TO NEW CHEESE.\\nHAW came back to his friend HEW and told his experience expecting him to turn out for searching. but HEW didnt.\\nso he left him there and returned for his new treasure. before coming he told him about the way he felt and shared the cheese wid him.\\nHAW started his journey back to the maze.\\n\\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FIND AND ENJOY NEW CHEESE, YOU CHANGE COURSE.\\nNOTICING SMALL CHANGES EARLY HELPS YOU ADAPT TO BIGGER CHANGES THAT ARE TO COME.\\nfinally haw saw a bigger chamber wid all the variety of cheese wid enormous quantity and was happy to find the rodents der enjoying the cheese. but this time haw was ready for the change observing the minute changes so tat he could act fast.\\n\\nAs days passed one fine day he heard the footsteps and guessed it was HEW and was happy finally he started searching for the new cheese..!!!\\n\\n(HAW could have gone to HEW and say about the new cheese at the chamber N. but he didnt since one cannot infuse the seeds to overcome the fear and accept the change . it should be from inself)\\n\\nso evryone out der.... let us\\nANTICIPATE CHANGE\\nADAPT TO CHANGE QUICKLY\\nENJOY THE CHANGE\\nBE READY TO CHANGE QUICKLY,AGAIN AND AGAIN\\n\\nSo who you are ??? SCURRY SNIFFY HEM OR HAW ??\\nAccepting changes like Scurry and Sniffy\\nor else learning about the advantages of accepting changes\\nor else hanging with the question... \\\" who moved my cheese??\\\"\\n\\nALL THE BEST.... :)\",\n          \"In the EU we have browser choice, but few know about it  The EU has been tougher on monopolies than the American antitrust authorities. This has been good for Europe and bad for America. In Europe we have an amazing choice of fixed line internet providers for example. In the USA, there is generally one DSL provider and one Cable provider per territory. As a result, we have more bandwidth for less money. This is surprising because, in general, there is more choice at a better price for a lot of goods and services in the USA, including cars, banking and financial services, gadgets, etc. But the problem with the USA is that sometimes lobbying is more influential than the common good. In Europe, our career public servants seem to be less immune to lobbying (although not always, and banking, for example, seems to be an exception and most countries protect their local banks).  But recently, the EU has given us more choice in Europe. This time is the freedom to choose our browser. But as this survey shows most Europeans, around three quarters of them, are not aware of this choice. It turns out that Spain is the country with the lowest browser choice awareness in Europe.\",\n          \" Yesterday I attended a biweekly meeting of an informal a UC Berkeley group devoted to Python in science (Py4Science), organized by Fernando Perez. The format (in honor of my visit) was a series of 4-minute lightning talks about various projects using Python in the scientific world (at Berkeley and elsewhere) followed by an hourlong Q&A session. This meant I didn't have to do a presentation and still got to interact with the audience for an hour -- my ideal format.\\n\\nI was blown away by the wide variety of Python use for scientific work. It looks like Python (with extensions like numpy) is becoming a standard tool for many sciences that need to process large amounts of data, from neuroimaging to astronomy.\\n\\nHere is a list of the topics presented (though not in the order presented). All these describing Python software; I've added names and affiliations insofar I managed to get them. (Thanks to Jarrod Millman for providing me with a complete list.)
